Hey, I’m Fatih. I currently work as a Research Scientist on the **BikeDetect** project, which aims to improve cycling safety through computer vision. You can learn more about the project here: <a href="https://bike-detect.vlba.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BikeDetect</a>.

My research interests lie in **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing**. Right now, I’m focused on an object detection problem designed to help create a safer cycling environment in the city of **Osnabrück, Germany**.

I’m continuously learning and deepening my understanding of **Deep Learning** concepts, methods, and practical applications.
